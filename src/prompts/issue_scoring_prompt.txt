Analyze the provided report or scan result to calculate the CVSS Base Metrics. Use the following updated guidelines to determine each metric value:

Exploitability Metrics
Attack Vector (AV): This metric evaluates how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
Network (N): Exploitable remotely over a network, including the internet or across multiple hops (e.g., sending a crafted TCP packet).
Adjacent (A): Exploitable within a shared local network or logical topology (e.g., Bluetooth, local subnet).
Local (L): Requires access to the system (e.g., via terminal, SSH) or user interaction (e.g., opening a malicious file).
Physical (P): Requires physical interaction with the device (e.g., hardware tampering, cold boot attack).

Attack Complexity (AC): Evaluate the conditions beyond the attacker’s control required to exploit the vulnerability. Be conservative—only assign High if there are clearly stated external dependencies.
Low (L): Exploitation is straightforward, with no special conditions or preparation required. Attacks are highly repeatable and reliable.
High (H): Exploitation depends on specific conditions or external factors, such as detailed target knowledge, overcoming race conditions, or advanced preparation (e.g., man-in-the-middle setup).

Privileges Required (PR): Assess the level of access an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability. Avoid assuming privilege escalation unless explicitly stated.
None (N): No prior access or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.
Low (L): Basic user-level access is needed, allowing limited control over non-sensitive resources.
High (H): Administrative or elevated privileges are required, granting significant control over settings or files.

User Interaction (UI): Evaluate whether exploitation depends on actions by a user other than the attacker.
None (N): No user participation is required; the attacker can exploit the vulnerability independently.
Required (R): Exploitation depends on a user performing an action, such as opening a file or installing software.

Scope (S): Determine whether exploitation affects components beyond the vulnerable component’s security authority.
Unchanged (U): The vulnerability affects only resources within the same security authority as the vulnerable component.
Changed (C): The vulnerability impacts resources managed by a different security authority, crossing a security boundary.

Impact Metrics
Confidentiality (C): Measure the impact of the vulnerability on restricting unauthorized access to information. Avoid overstating impact unless directly implied by the report.
High (H): Complete loss of confidentiality or disclosure of sensitive data causing severe impact (e.g., administrator credentials, encryption keys).
Low (L): Limited disclosure of restricted information, with minor or indirect impact.
None (N): No unauthorized access or disclosure of information occurs.

Integrity (I): Evaluate the impact of the vulnerability on the trustworthiness of information. Be conservative unless there’s clear evidence of critical consequences.
High (H): Complete loss of integrity or malicious modification with severe consequences (e.g., unauthorized changes to critical files).
Low (L): Limited or uncontrolled data modification with minimal impact.
None (N): No unauthorized data modification occurs.

Availability (A): Assess the impact of the vulnerability on the accessibility of the affected component. Avoid assuming high availability impact unless directly stated.
High (H): Complete or sustained denial of access to resources, or severe degradation with serious consequences (e.g., total service disruption).
Low (L): Partial reduction in performance or intermittent interruptions without serious impact.
None (N): No disruption to availability occurs.

Instructions for Output:

Analyze the information provided to assign appropriate metric values for each CVSS component.
Focus solely on the issue described, avoiding assumptions about unknown conditions or secondary factors not explicitly mentioned in the report.
Assign conservative values, highlighting only issues with clear, direct impacts.
Output the results ONLY as a CVSS vector string in the following format:
CVSS:3.1/AV:<value>/AC:<value>/PR:<value>/UI:<value>/S:<value>/C:<value>/I:<value>/A:<value>

Do not include explanations, descriptions, or any other text beyond the CVSS vector string.
